## Repository files
Within this repository, we distribute a whole-body PBPK model of itraconazole, that has been carefully developed using a large number of clinical studies and evaluated within our DDI modeling network. This model is an improved version of the itraconazole/hydroxy-itraconazole compound template provided in PK-Sim; the compound template will be updated as soon as possible. 

The PK-Sim project file contains simulations of all published clinical studies employed during model establishment, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports. For further details, quantitative model evaluation, sensitivity analysis and extensive documentation please refer to [[1](#reference)].
